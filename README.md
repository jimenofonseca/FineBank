If all diagrams are showing, then the tool is working! now you can do other stuff, like parsing and visualizing your own data.

## Prepare your financial data

The first step is to prepare your financial data in a format that can be understood by the FineBank app. It is the most time-consuming part of the excercise, but it should become handy in further versions.

1. Get the example_data included in this repository from [here](https://github.com/JIMENOFONSECA/FineBank/raw/master/example_data/example_data.zip)
2. Navigate to `example_data/INPUTS/BANKING`.
3. Store your statementes from DBS in the DBS folder. Alternatively store your statements form Postfinance in the Postfinance folder.

4. After that, Navigate to `example_data/INPUTS/INVESTMENTS.`
5. Use the excel file in `example_data/INPUTS/INVESTMENTS` to input and categorize your investments.
6. To create a new acount or type of investment just create a new worksheet in the excel file. The FineBAnk App will use the name of the worksheet as the name of the investment.

6. As a last step you will need to configure the `CATEGORIES.XLS` file. the file stores a relation of categories and vendors. This will help the tool to more accurrately categorize your data.
